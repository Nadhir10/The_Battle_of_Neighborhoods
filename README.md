# The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods
As I was searching for ideas about this project, I encoutred some websites that compares neighborhoods, with a closer look I found that these websites use generally information about the cost of life or crime rates, but almost none of them tries to find similraties between the neighborhoods venues. Let's now imagine someone who is moving to a new city, other than the other critera, he may be interested in findng the most similar (familiar) neighborhood to his actual one. This project is about finding, in a new city, the neighborhoods most similar to the user actual neighborhood.
